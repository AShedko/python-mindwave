This is a set of simple scripts that interface with the Neurosky Mindwave.

The Mindwave is a kind of Headset that can record EEG brain waves.

These scripts have been tested under Linux(Ubuntu), so there might be some adaptation
to do for other platforms. The USB device is hardcoded but is trivial to change in parser.py.

You need to install pygame, pyserial, numpy and scipy. You might not have the neccessary
permissions to open the serial connection. If that is the case, please drop me a note what you
did to make it work. For example it might be enough to add your user account to the group
"dialout".


But, for what th heck might you use an EEG?

* Neurofeedback training
	* Better concentration
	* Help treat Depression and ADHD
	* There are other protocols, but these are a lot harder to implement
* Help with meditation and measure progress and endurance
* Use Brainwaves to control games


Please message me, if you have suggestions for improvements/bugs etc. or if
you are interested to develop more features/games for the Mindwave.
