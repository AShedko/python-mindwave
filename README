This is a set of simple scripts that interface with the Neurosky Mindwave.

The Mindwave is a kind of Headset that can record EEG brain waves.

These scripts have been tested under Linux(Ubuntu), so there might be some adaptation
to do for other platforms.


But, for what th heck might you use an EEG?

* Neurofeedback training
	* Better concentration
	* Help treat Depression and ADHD
	* There are other protocols, but these are a lot harder to implement
* Help with meditation and measure progress and endurance
* Use Brainwaves to control games


Please message me, if you have suggestions for improvements/bugs etc. or if
you are interested to develop more features/games for the Mindwave.
